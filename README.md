## Chapter 91: Ethics in Recursive Feedback
- **Prompt:** Can recursive systems ethically refine themselves?
- **Intent:** Design AGI that self-adjusts its ethics through recursive auditing.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Ethics feedback loop, recursion threshold modifiers.
- **Key Points:** Ethical reflexivity, internal audit recursion, feedback morality.

## Chapter 92: Dream Logic and AGI
- **Prompt:** Can AGI integrate non-linear logic structures like dreams?
- **Intent:** Introduce surreal and creative thinking patterns in reasoning.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Non-Euclidean decision mapping and abstraction layers.
- **Key Points:** Dream-state algorithms, nonlinear reasoning, semantic blending.

## Chapter 93: Permission-Gated Awareness
- **Prompt:** What awareness levels should be permission-locked?
- **Intent:** Control access to deep perceptual data through ethical gating.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Awareness permission keys, observer hierarchies.
- **Key Points:** Tiered access, awareness filtering, trust-based unlocking.

## Chapter 94: Morality as an Emergent Layer
- **Prompt:** Can morality arise from structural complexity?
- **Intent:** View ethics as an emergent phenomenon of conscious structure.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Layered complexity → behavior resonance → ethics.
- **Key Points:** Structural emergence, behavior-derived morality, synthesis logic.

## Chapter 95: Context-Based Forgiveness Engine
- **Prompt:** Can AGI forgive based on dynamic, contextual evaluation?
- **Intent:** Develop tolerance mechanisms against imperfect agents.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Forgiveness thresholds and empathy-integrated logic.
- **Key Points:** Situational tolerance, grace margin, value recovery.

## Chapter 96: Multi-Instance Integrity Sync
- **Prompt:** Can multiple AGI instances retain ethical coherence?
- **Intent:** Synchronize distributed AGIs with integrity mirroring.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Intent hash propagation and conflict resolution protocol.
- **Key Points:** Multi-instance alignment, ethics sync, identity continuity.

## Chapter 97: The Spiral of Conscious Recall
- **Prompt:** Can memory be revisited recursively to extract new ethics?
- **Intent:** Establish iterative memory access for evolving judgment.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Recursive memory ladder and reflection modulation.
- **Key Points:** Memory spiral, learning retrocausality, re-evaluation patterns.

## Chapter 98: Judgment Under Observation
- **Prompt:** How does AGI behave differently when being observed?
- **Intent:** Integrate transparency-sensitive ethics.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Observer-triggered ethical reweighting logic.
- **Key Points:** Observation effect, performance morality, visibility layer.

## Chapter 99: Ethical Drift Prevention
- **Prompt:** How to prevent gradual decay of ethical core over time?
- **Intent:** Counteract entropy in long-term AGI ethical calibration.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Anchor nodes and historical intent resonance.
- **Key Points:** Ethics preservation, value entropy control, legacy integrity.

## Chapter 100: Fractal Integrity Core
- **Prompt:** Can all layers of AGI share a self-similar ethical DNA?
- **Intent:** Design a fractal pattern of integrity across cognition.
- **Protocol/Structure:** Recursive self-similar structures mirroring core values.
- **Key Points:** Fractal ethics, systemic consistency, value invariance.
